# About

## Project Description


The project is part of the Integrated Modelling research theme in the WAMSI-Westport Marine Science Program.
Fundamental to assessing the impacts of future changes within Cockburn Sound and associated waters, and identifying useful mitigation options is the development of a water quality model able to link hydrodynamics, biogeochemistry and the essential ecosystem processes. Coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical models can help focus management effort and provide a vehicle to bring together to the diversity of data that has been collected over many years and is being collected within this science program.
Key attributes of the system that need to be clearly understood and quantified include oxygen, nutrients, sediment, algae and water clarity. The link between water quality and benthic communities such as seagrass in Cockburn Sound is also well established, and an integrated modelling tool is needed to quantify the links between them for the purposes of impact assessment and designing mitigation portfolios. 


This project will:


**Deliver the first base platform of a coupled hydrodynamic - water quality model for Cockburn Sound and surrounding waters â€“ termed the Cycle I model in the head agreement.
The model developed under this agreement will be available for use by researchers and industry for scenario assessment, and further research and development.**

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports; for example, a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.


## Key Tasks


* Setup of Hydrodynamic-Biogeochemical Model for Cockburn Sound and surrounding waters

* Updated mesh, refined around Cockburn Sound and designed to nest within the regional ROMS model being used to supply oceanic boundary conditions

* Creation of processing scripts for creating ocean boundary condition files from ROMS, SCERM, and WRF model outputs using python, or as agreed with the project steering group

* Configuration of material zones in the simulation based on bathymetry and benthic substrate.

* Operation of the TUFLOW-FV hydrodynamic model for representative climatological simulation periods and model assessment and benchmarking against the model performance metrics achieved in the Water Corporation simulations.

* Data collation and processing to create nutrient loading boundary condition files, considering a groundwater and local stormwater inputs

* Development of a base AED simulation for the agreed simulation period with a configuration developed in collaboration with the project steering group

* Creation of a benthic input csv file for seagrass biomass

* Model assessment of water quality (oxygen, nutrients, turbidity and chl-a) from routine monitoring sites and the DWER monitoring buoys, able to compare:
+ Time series comparison
+Statistical measures of model performance and error metrics  
+ Vertical profile time-series comparisons



## Usage 

Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`.

The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

## Render book

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
